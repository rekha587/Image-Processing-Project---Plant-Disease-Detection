# Image-Processing-Project: Plant-Disease-Detection

# Abstract:

Agriculture plays a significant role to both human and economy of a nation; that is to say, it is the backbone of a nation's economy. In addition to providing food and raw material, it also provides employment opportunities to very large percentage of the population.
To promote sustainable development, the smart city implies a global vision that merges various technologies like artificial intelligence, big data, decision making, information and communication technology (ICT), and the Internet-of-Things (IOT). These processes above are related for solving real life problems.

# Problem Statement:

When we think about technologies in Agriculture, Plant Disease Detection is one of the most mind boggling issue that exists. We can easily say that new technologies are being developed and researches are being done to detect weather a plant is healthy or diseased by many methods in today’s world. Be it using Deep Learning and with the help of Neural Network, new techniques are still being discovered.
Our approach for Detecting weather a plant leaf is healthy or unhealthy is by using a classical Machine Learning Algorithm , Pre-processing the data using Image Processing. Machine based approaches for disease detection and classification of agricultural product have become an important part of civilization.

## Dataset Details:

The dataset used for this project has been taken from Plant-Village- Dataset which can be found from online resources. The Data fed for the modeling is of Apple Leaves. For implementation purpose the Dataset comprises of 2 set of images that are Diseased and Healthy which contains images of leaves with respective labels. The Diseased Folder contains diseased/unhealthy, affected by Apple Scab, Black Rot or Cedar Apple Rust, etc. The Healthy Folder consists of Green and healthy images.

## PROPERTIES OF IMAGES
